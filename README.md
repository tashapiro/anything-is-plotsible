## üèÜ Fun Challenges

Challenges series are a fun way to learn new data viz tricks, and a great way to meet new people with similar interests. Other data viz challenges to look out for:

-   [**#TidyTuesday**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) - series created by **R for Data Science Online Learning Community**. Every Tuesday, a new data set is submitted and participants are invited to analyze and share their own data visualizations using the data.

-   [**#30DayMapChallenge**](https://30daymapchallenge.com/) - usually occurs in November. Tool agnostic challenge, each day features a prompt related to GIS/mapping (e.g. points, choropleth, lines, Open Street Map data, etc). Data is not typically provided, participants are invited to create visuals with data sets of their choice.

-   [**#30DayChartChallenge**](https://30daychartchallenge.org/) - similar to #30DayMapChallenge, this challenge has a specific prompt each day. Usually occurs in April, initially launched in 2022.

## üìö Free Resources for Beginners

There are tons of data visualization tutorials available online. It's impossible to list them all. Here are a few that have helped me in the past:

-   [**Hands On Programming with R**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) - a walk-thru of how to set up R and navigate RStudio. Covers basic R programming concepts.
-   [**ggplot2 cheatsheet**](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization.pdf) - the Posit team created a nice cheatsheet guide to cover the basics and cover the differences between geoms.
-   [**The R Graph Gallery**](https://r-graph-gallery.com/) - Blog site maintained by [Yan Holtz](https://twitter.com/R_Graph_Gallery) and other contributors. Coding walk-thrus are available for all types of charts. I frequent this site a lot for inspiration.
-   [**ggplot2 Tutorial for Beautiful Plotting in R**](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/) - C√©dric Scherer's work is exceptional - he's a ggplot2 Data Vizard. I particularly like this post that covers the basics.
-   [**The MockUp**](https://themockup.blog/)- Tom Mock covers a lot of different data and data viz topics on his blog. I love his content on tables. Tom is also the brains behind `gtExtras`
-   [**reactablemftr Cookbook**](https://kcuilla.github.io/reactablefmtr/articles/reactablefmtr_cookbook.html) - Tons of great examples how to use `reactablefmtr` on Kyle Cuilla's site.
-   [**TidyTuesday with David Robinson**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ub92c-5xFQ&list=PL19ev-r1GBwkuyiwnxoHTRC8TTqP8OEi8)- If you're learning by watching, David Robinson has a great YouTube series where he walks thru different TidyTuesday prompts in R.
-   [**Highcharter Cookbook**](https://www.tmbish.me/lab/highcharter-cookbook/) - Great blog post by Tom Bishop walking thru different examples of how to render `highcharter` graphics. Maybe more suitable intermediate R users.

Some of my previous ggplot2 workshops:

-   [**Data Storytelling in R**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZbc091mybE&t=6s) - an introductory `ggplot2` workshop I put together with Women Who Code.
-   [**Introduction to {ggplot2}**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnNWkF9Jtj4&t=6s) - A hands-on introductory workshop I put together for R-Ladies Paris.
-   [**Plotnine Workshop**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUrRYYFDWJc&t=4s) - `plotnine` is `ggplot2` for Python. This workshop is an introductory lesson, materials available to run in Goolge Collab.
